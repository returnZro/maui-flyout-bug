#### MAUI FlyoutPage Issues in Android

XForms supports having the Flyout page as a non-root page of the app. And we can push any content page on top of Flyout page via main navigation stack (not flyout detail's navigation stack).
In Maui, iOS works similar to XF and no issues. FlyoutPage is broken in MAUI Android and breaks backward compatibility for XF.

*Issue #1:*
  IconImageSource is not displayed on the detail of the Flyout in Android. Instead, a navigation back button is displayed and the TitleView defined on the detail page is ignored.

*Issue #2:*
  Consider the following navigation stack:
```
  [0] - MainPage (A Navigation page)
  [1] - FlyoutPage (Flyout is a Content Page, Detail is a Navigation Page)
  [2] - ContentPage
```
When you push a content page on top of Flyout and pop it from `main` navigation stack, an empty detail page is displayed
